## Boy or Girl?: An Interactive Experience
#### by Dana Capistrano



### Overview
An interactional experience guiding the user through a self-reflective journey on one’s own gender. “Boy or Girl?”, at first,  draws the user in with its title then educates and provides resources. It guides the user through three different topics that might help them get a better understanding about gender identities. First being the difference between sex assigned at birth versus gender identities, the second is the wide range of gender identities, and lastly resouces for individuals or parents of individuals who are interested in transitioning. “Boy or Girl?” aims to eliminate discrimination and stereotyping of people who are not cisgender, or those who do not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth. It invites the user to consider their own identities within others as well. Eventually creating a space where we are self aware and respectful of ourselves and others as we leave the experience.
